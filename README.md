# COSC360-Systems-Programming
## Fall 2020
I particularly enjoyed this class and its projects. Labs 3+ are particularly interesting:\
Lab 3 fakemake: uses system calls such as stat(2v) and system(3) to automate compilation of C executables.\
Lab 4 tarc and tarx: can be used to create and extract tar files.\
Lab 6 malloc: manual implementation of malloc() and free() using sbrk().\
Lab 7 jshell: custom implementation of a command line shell.\
Lab 8 jtalk: relatively simple chat server implemented with threads and mutexes, can be compared to its Java implementation in COSC365 repository.
